Import the necessary libraries for handling user input, text processing, and generating responses.

Define a function is_valid_age that takes the user's age as input and returns True if the age is between 16 and 28, and False otherwise.

Define a function process_input that takes the user's input as a string and returns a response based on the input. This function can use various techniques for text processing such as keyword matching, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models to understand the user's intent and generate an appropriate response.

Prompt the user for their age and store it in a variable.

Use a while loop to continually listen for user input until the user says "bye".

Inside the while loop, check if the user's age is valid by calling the is_valid_age function. If the age is valid, call the process_input function with the user's input and display the generated response to the user. If the age is not valid, prompt the user to enter a valid age.

After each response, prompt the user for another input until they say "bye".

Once the user says "bye", exit the loop and bid the user farewell.
